# Welcome to the Platform Mesh Project

<img src="../assets/logo.svg" alt="Platform Mesh Logo" width="200" />

:wave: Welcome to the official GitHub presence of Platform Mesh. We are part of [ApeiroRA](https://apeirora.eu/content/projects/) which is an Important Project of Common European Interest - Next Generation Cloud Infrastructures and Services (IPCEI-CIS). Platform Mesh defines an environment that allows service providers to offer services of any kind and service consumers to discover those services, order capabilities, and control their lifecycle.

## :globe_with_meridians: ApeiroRA?

ApeiroRA is a reference blueprint for an open, flexible, secure, and compliant next-generation cloud-edge continuum and therefore a key contribution to IPCEI-CIS. At a high level, the projects of ApeiroRA allow users to provider-agnostically fetch, request and consume services, and for service providers to describe, offer and provision their services.

Learn more about ApeiroRA by checking out the official website at [https://apeirora.eu/](https://apeirora.eu/).

## :handshake: Platform Mesh

Platform Mesh establishes interoperability between multiple providers by building upon the Kubernetes API and resource model. Developers and admins can discover, access, and order services from various sources through their beloved kubectl.
## :pushpin: Platform Mesh and NeoNephos


Platform Mesh has been donated to the NeoNephos Foundation, a Linux Foundation initiative dedicated to advancing open-source projects that align with the strategic objectives of IPCEI-CIS under neutral governance. Learn more about NeoNephos and our role within it [here](https://neonephos.org).
